In this assignment you will practice putting together a simple image classification pipeline, based on the k-Nearest Neighbor or the SVM/Softmax classifier. The goals of this assignment are as follows:

1. understand the basic Image Classification pipeline and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages)

2. understand the train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for hyperparameter tuning.

3. develop proficiency in writing efficient vectorized code with numpy

4. implement and apply a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier

5. implement and apply a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier

6. implement and apply a Softmax classifier

7. implement and apply a Two layer neural network classifier

8. understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers

9. get a basic understanding of performance improvements from using higher-level representations than raw pixels (e.g. color histograms, Histogram of Gradient (HOG) features)
